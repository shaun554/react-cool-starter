A simple but feature rich starter boilerplate for you to build an universal web application with the best development experience and best practices.

Built on the top of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router). Includes all the hot stuff and modern web development tools such as Webpack 2, [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), React Hot Loader 3 and [Redux Devtools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension). See section **[“Features”](## Features)** for more other awesome features you can expect.

I will improve this starter boilerplate continuously and keep all of the technologies on trend. Welcome to join me if you want. Hope you guys love it :)

## Quick Start

**1. You can start by clone this repository on your local machine by running:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-starter.git
cd react-cool-starter
``` 

**2. Install all of the npm packages:**

```sh
npm install
```

**3. Start to run it:**

```sh
npm run start:production  # Building bundle and running production server
```

Now the app should be running at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)


## NPM Scripts

I use [Better NPM Run](https://github.com/benoror/better-npm-run) to manage the scripts in a better way, which also provides the compatibility of corss-platform. Listing all the scripts as following:

|`npm run <script>`|Description|
|------------------|-----------|
|`start`|Run your app on the development server at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled.|
|`start:production`|Compiles the app to `./public/dist/` and run it on the production server at `localhost:8080`.|
|`start:prod`|Run your app on the production server only at `localhost:8080`.|
|`clean`|Remove the `dist` folder from `./public/` to clean the compiled stuff.|
|`build`|Clean the compiled stuff and compile your app to `./public/dist`.|
|`eslint`|Lint all `.js` files.|
|`stylelint`|Lint all `.scss` files.|
|`lint`|Lint all `.js` and `.scss` files.|

Note: If you encounter the error of `webpack-isomorphic-tools (waiting for the first webpack build to finish)`, try to run `npm run build` to fix it.
