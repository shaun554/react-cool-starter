## Requirements

* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 5.0
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) >= 3.0


## Getting Started

**1. You can start by clone the repository on your local machine by running:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-starter.git
cd react-cool-starter
``` 

**2. Install all of the npm packages:**

```bash
npm install
```

**3. Start to run it:**

```bash
npm run start:production    # Building bundle and running production server
```

Now the app should be running at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)


## NPM Script Commands

I use [better-npm-run](https://github.com/benoror/better-npm-run) to manage the scripts in a better way, which also provides the compatibility of corss-platform. All of the scripts are listed as following:

`npm run <script>`|Description
------------------|-----------
`start`|Run your app on the development server at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled.
`start:production`|Compiles the app to `./public/dist` and run it on the production server at `localhost:8080`.
`start:prod`|Run your app on the production server only at `localhost:8080`.
`build`|Clean the previous compiled stuff and compile your app to `./public/dist`.
`lint`|Lint all `.js` and `.scss` files.
`lint:js`|Lint all `.js` files.
`lint:style`|Lint all `.scss` files.
`test`|Run testing once.
`test:watch`|Run testing on every test file change.
`clean:all`|Remove the `./public/dist` and the `./coverage` folder.
`clean:build`|Remove the `./public/dist` folder to clean the compiled stuff.
`clean:coverage`|Remove the `./coverage` folder to clean the code coverage report.

Note: If you get the the following message, try to run `npm run build` to fix it.

## Server Side Security and Performance

Concering to the security and performance for Express in production, I already setup some middlewares for you:

* [helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) - Helps secure Express server with various HTTP headers.
* [hpp](https://github.com/analog-nico/hpp) - Express middleware to protect against HTTP Parameter Pollution attacks.
* [compression](https://github.com/expressjs/compression) - Gzip compression support for speeding up Express server responses.

Note: It's just a basic protected mechanism for your app, you can see [Security best practices](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-security.html) for more advanced configuration.


## Setup Redux DevTools Extension

The [Redux Devtools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) let us wire up our Redux app to a time-traveling debugger. It's enabled in development only. You can follow the installation guide to use it:

**For Chrome**

* from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)
* or build it with `npm i && npm run build:extension` and [load the extension's folder](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) `./build/extension`
* or run it in dev mode with npm i && npm start and [load the extension's folder](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) `./dev`.

**For Firefox**

* from [AMO](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)
* or build it with `npm i && npm run build:firefox` and [load the extension's folder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox) `./build/firefox` (just select a file from inside the dir).

**For Electron**

* just specify REDUX_DEVTOOLS in [electron-devtools-installer](https://github.com/GPMDP/electron-devtools-installer).

**For other browsers and non-browser environment**

* use [remote-redux-devtools](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/remote-redux-devtools).


## Overview

### Stateless Functional Components

[React 0.14](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) introduced a simpler way to define components called [stateless functional components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#stateless-functions). These components are written in plain JavaScript functions. In the starter boilerplate I use it wherever possible.

### Adding Routes

Add your routes in `./src/routes.js`. For example:

```javascript
<Route path="/" component={App}>
  <IndexRoute component={Home} />
  <Route path="NewRoute" component={NewRoute} />  // Adding a new route
  <Route path="*" component={NotFound} />
</Route>
```

### Managing Title, Meta, Styles and Scripts

The parent `App.js` defines the base title and meta in a `<Helmet {...config.app} />` component. Any sub-component can override/add properties (supports meta, link, script, style tags and html attributes). See the [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) documents for more info.

### App config

You can store app settings under `./src/config`. By default the `default.js` will be loaded. If the `process.env.NODE_ENV` matches to production, the `prod.js` will be used insteadlly, and it inherits the data info from `default.js`.

You can access the correct config with:

```javascript
import config from './config';
```

### Styles

The starter boilerplate supports CSS, SASS and [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-Modules/css-Modules) is enabled by default. I use [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-loader) plugin to parse CSS and add autoprefixer to your stylesheet. You can access your stylesheet with two ways.

**With CSS Modules:**

```javascript
import styles from './Home.scss';

// ...

render() {
  return (
    <div className={styles.Home}> // The className matches one of CSS classes in your SCSS file
      <Helmet title="Home" />
      {this.displayUserList()}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Without CSS Modules (you need to turn off CSS Modules from `./tools/webpack/index.js`):**

```javascript
import './Home.scss';

// ...

render() {
  return (
    <div className="Home"> // Use the CSS class as normal
      <Helmet title="Home" />
      {this.displayUserList()}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Image and Font

It's super easy to render the image and font both on client and server, the usage would be like below.

Using image:

```javascript
// Require an image 
<img src={require('./logo.svg')} alt="Logo" role="presentation" />
```

Using font-awesome:

```javascript
// With CSS Modules
import styles from './myStyle.scss';

// ...

return (
  <div>
    <div><i className={styles.iconUser}></i> Welly</div>
  </div>
);

// Without CSS Modules
import './font-awesome.css';

// ...

return (
  <div>
    <div><i className="fa fa-user"></i> Welly</div>
  </div>
);

```

For using CSS Modules, you have to set the proper font path in your scss file:

```
$fa-font-path:"../node_modules/font-awesome/fonts";
@import "../node_modules/font-awesome/scss/font-awesome";
.icon-user {
  @extend .fa;
  @extend .fa-user;
}
```

### Data fetching and client hydration

Just write Redux actions and stores as normal (read the [Redux](https://rackt.github.io/redux/) guide if you are new). The starter boilerplate using [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) as the data fetcher, it's quite simple and easy to use. If the action creator is asynchronous then it will return a Promise (or a Promise.all) in the inner function.

You can write dispatches for actions that must be called for the container to be ready:

```javascript
// Write a static function which be called by server and client
static fetchData(dispatch, params) {
  // Add the asynchronous actions which must be called while paga loading here
  return Promise.all([
    dispatch(action.fetchAnUserIfNeeded(params.id)),
  ]);
}
```

Then invoke the actions in `componentDidMount`. This ensures that if the component is reached on the client, then the same actions will be invoked. It's up to the action to figure out if fetches for data need to be made or not:

```javascript
componentDidMount() {
  const { dispatch, params } = this.props;
  
  // Invoke the action for client rendering
  UserInfo.fetchData(dispatch, params);
}
```

### Boost App Performance by Shallow Compare

If your React component's render function is "pure" (in other words, it renders the same result given the same props and state), you can use [shallowCompare](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/shallow-compare.html) with `shouldComponentUpdate` for preventing it from re-render.

Luckily, we writing our stores using [Immutable-js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), the immutable data structures provides you a cheap and less verbose way to track changes on objects, which is all we need to implement `shouldComponentUpdate`. See the [React Advanced Performance](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/advanced-performance.html#shouldcomponentupdate-in-action) topic for more info.

How Shallow Compare is practiced:

```javascript
import shallowCompare from 'react-addons-shallow-compare';

// ...

class Home extends Component {

  // ...

  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    // Implement the Shallow Compare helper function
    return shallowCompare(this, nextProps, nextState);
  }

  // ...
}
```

### Unit Tests

The starter boilerplate uses [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) to run your unit tests, it uses [karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html) as the test runner, and uses [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) as the testing utility for React, which makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output. Moreover it also uses [chai](http://chaijs.com/) as the assertion library and uses [sinon](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon) to provide the standalone test spies, stubs and mocks. The unit tests focus on four parts as below:

* Actions
* Containers
* Components
* Reducers

By the way, I use [babel-plugin-istanbul](https://github.com/istanbuljs/babel-plugin-istanbul) to instruments your code with Istanbul coverage, the report is generated in `./coverage` folder. You can configure `.babelrc` to ignore the files which you don't want to cover. For example:

```bash
{
  "env": {
    "test": {
      "plugins": [
        ["istanbul", {
          "exclude": [          
            "**/*.-test.js"   # ignore testing files
          ]
        }]
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can also use [istanbul's ignore hints](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/blob/master/ignoring-code-for-coverage.md#ignoring-code-for-coverage-purposes) to specify specific lines of code to skip instrumenting.
